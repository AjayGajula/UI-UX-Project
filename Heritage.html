                  One of Seven Wonders of the World, White Marble Mughal
                  Architecture, the Taj Mahal was built by emperor Shah Jahan in
                  the memory of his wife, Mumtaj Mahal. It is located at the
                  bank of river Yamuna in Agra. It was completed in 1653 with
                  the estimated cost of 32 million Indian rupees which would
                  today stand up to 58 billion Indian rupees. It is considered
                  as the best example of Mughal architecture worldwide and is
                  called the “Jewel of Muslim Art in India”. This is probably
                  the monument that is most recognised the world over for its

                  their Nagara style symbolism and erotic figures and
                  sculptures. These sensuous stone carvings of human and animal
                  form in erotic poses are very aesthetically portrayed and
                  stand testimony to the rich cultural heritage of India. Most

                  Bodh Gaya is located almost 96kilometrese away from Patna,
                  Bihar and is one of the Indian heritage sites recognised by
                  UNESCO. It’s an important religious centre for the Buddhists
                  as this was the place where Mahatma Buddha attained
                  enlightenment. The holy Bodhi Tree is the site where
                  Siddhartha gained Enlightenment and became Gautam Buddha. The
                  famous Mahabodhi Temple was established in the reign of Ashoka
                  the Great in about approximately 250 BCE. It’s one of the
                  earliest Buddhist temples. Currently, the Mahabodhi Temple
                  Complex at Bodh Gaya comprises the 50 m tall Mahabodhi Temple,
                  the Vajrasana, sacred Bodhi Tree and other six sacred sites of
                  Buddha’s enlightenment, surrounded by numerous ancient Votive
                  stupas. Owing to all these factors, Bodh Gaya is considered to
                  be the holiest pilgrimage spot for the Buddhists.
